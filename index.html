    <td>Ram card</td>		
    <td> RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is what you are actually using at any one time. It is a computer storage location that allows information to be stored and accessed quickly from random location within DRAM on a memory module. Because information is accessed randomly instead of sequentially like a CD or hard drive the computer is able to access the data much faster than it would if it was only reading the hard drive.</td>
